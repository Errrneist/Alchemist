# PROJECT Stargazer
## Machine Learning Development and Experiment
* Intended to learn ML using turi, SFrame, and other great stuff.
* This repo has no code for CSE 416 homework. Just notes and experiments and projects.
* Great stuff is coming...as I don't quite know what that is yet.

## Regression
## Classification
## Clusters and Similiarity
## Recommending Products
## Deep Learning and Searching for Images

(PS: Project name came from Gundam-Stargazer in which "Stargazer" is an AI(Codename 401) that 
reads human input and drives the robot(Gundam Stargazer) to explore outer space.)
