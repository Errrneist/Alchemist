# Stargazer
Machine Learning Development and Experiment
Intended to learn ML using turi, SFrame, and other great stuff.
Great stuff is coming...as I don't quite know what that is yet.

(PS: Project name came from Gundam-Stargazer in which "Stargazer" is an AI(Codename 401) that 
reads human input and drives the robot(Gundam Stargazer) to explore outer space.)
