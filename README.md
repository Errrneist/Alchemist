# Project Alchemist
* Developer:  *[Hongjun Wu](https://github.com/Errrneist/Stargazer/blob/master/Documents/Resume-Github.pdf)*
## Machine Learning Development and Experiment
* Intended to learn ML using Python, TuriCreate, OpenCV, TensorFlow, etc.
* Name from a joke among many Chinese programmers: 'Machine Learning is like Alchemy.'

## TuriCreate
#### Regression
* Added a notebook for bias and variances.
#### Classification
#### Clusters and Similiarity
#### Recommending Products
#### Deep Learning and Searching for Images

## OpenCV
#### T-Rex
* A small program to detect objects in an image using machine vision.

## TensorFlow
(PS: Project name came from Gundam-Stargazer in which "Stargazer" is an AI(Codename 401) that 
reads human input and drives the robot(Gundam Stargazer) to explore outer space.)
