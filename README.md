# PROJECT Stargazer
## Machine Learning Development and Experiment
* Intended to learn ML using Python, TuriCreate, TensorFlow, OpenCV, etc.
* Great stuff is coming...as I don't quite know what that is yet.

# TuriCreate
### Regression
### Classification
### Clusters and Similiarity
### Recommending Products
### Deep Learning and Searching for Images

(PS: Project name came from Gundam-Stargazer in which "Stargazer" is an AI(Codename 401) that 
reads human input and drives the robot(Gundam Stargazer) to explore outer space.)
